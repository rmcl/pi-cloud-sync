# piCloudSync

A RaspberryPi based file server that syncs files to a s3 bucket.

## How it Works

* Install onto a raspberry pi on your network.
* Connect to the pi as a guest via SAMBA (should work Mac/Windows/Linux)
* Drag files into the "upload" directory. Files will be automatically uploaded to a s3 bucket of your choice.
